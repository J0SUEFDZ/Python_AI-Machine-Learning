# Python_AI-Machine-Learning
AI-Machine Learning app, a simple linear model with a Loss function to evaluate it. Using genetic algorithms to optimize W y b, both associate to the model. With this, it was intended to locate the model in a random initial position, and by calculating the Loss obtained, the model was optimized in a way that approached the correct answer, to optimize the process.
